# Assignment-7-Data-Curation-and-Analysis-Coding
The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize GDP values of different countries over time. The project uses web scraping techniques to extract data from a website and uses Python libraries like pandas and matplotlib to clean and plot the data.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from Populationu, a website that provides provides  data on GDP values of different countries for the years 2022-2027. It can be found at https://www.populationu.com/gen/countries-by-gdp.

## Data Description
The data has the following attributes:

Rank: The rank of the country based on its GDP value.
Country: The name of the country.
2022-2027: The GDP value of the country in billions of dollars for the respective year.
The data is provided in string format, and the GDP values have commas as separators.

## Data License
The website does not provide any information about the license of the data.

## Potential Issues
One potential issue with this data is that it only provides GDP values and does not consider other factors like population, inflation, and exchange rates. This means that the GDP values may not reflect the actual economic conditions of the countries accurately. Another issue is that the data is sourced from a single website and may not be representative of the overall economic conditions of the countries.
